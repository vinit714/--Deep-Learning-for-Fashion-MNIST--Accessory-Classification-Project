# Deep Learning for Fashion-MNIST: Accessory Classification Project

This repository contains Python code to classify fashion items using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```
Usage
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-mnist-cnn.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd fashion-mnist-cnn
```

Run the Python script:
```
python fashion_mnist_cnn.py
```

Results

Upon running the script, you'll see the following results:

+ Training and testing data shapes.
+ Model summary.
+ Training with data augmentation.
+ Training and validation loss plots.
+ Training and validation accuracy plots.
+ Confusion matrix.
+ Classification report.
+ Final training and validation accuracies.
